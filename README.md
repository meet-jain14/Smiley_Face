😊 Smiley Face using HTML & CSS

This is a simple front-end activity where I created a smiley face using only HTML and CSS.
The project focuses on basic layout, positioning, and styling concepts in CSS.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the smiley face

CSS3 – Styling, positioning, and shapes

📁 Project Structure

│
├── index.html   # HTML structure
└── style.css    # CSS styling

🎨 Description

The face is created using a circular <div> with CSS border-radius.

Eyes are positioned using absolute positioning.

The mouth is styled as a curved shape using border-radius.

No images or JavaScript are used — everything is built purely with CSS.

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
